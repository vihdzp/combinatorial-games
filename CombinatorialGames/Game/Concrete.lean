# Combinatorial games from a type of states

In the literature, mathematicians often describe games as graphs, consisting of a set of states, as
well as move relations for the left and right players. We define a structure `ConcreteGame` which
facilitates this construction, bundling the left and right set functions along with the type, as
well as functions `ConcreteGame.toLGame` and `ConcreteGame.toIGame` which turn them into the
appropriate type of game.

Mathematically, `ConcreteGame.toLGame` is nothing but the corecursor on loopy games, while
`ConcreteGame.toIGame` is defined inductively.

## Design notes

When working with any "specific" game (nim, domineering, etc.) you can use  `ConcreteGame` to set up
the basic theorems and definitions, but the intent is that you're not working with `ConcreteGame`
directly most of the time.
