# Game functor

The type of games `IGame` is an inductive type, with a single constructor `ofSets` taking in two
small sets of games and outputting a new game. This suggests the definition:

```
inductive IGame : Type (u + 1)
  | ofSets (s t : Set IGame) [Small.{u} s] [Small.{u} t] : IGame
```

However, the kernel does not accept this, as `Set IGame = IGame → Prop` contains a non-positive
occurence of `IGame` (see [counterexamples.org](https://counterexamples.org/strict-positivity.html)
for an explanation of what this is and why it's disallowed). We can get around this technical
limitation using the machinery of `QPF`s (quotients of polynomial functors). We define a functor
`GameFunctor` by

```
def GameFunctor (α : Type (u + 1)) : Type (u + 1) :=
  {s : Set α × Set α // Small.{u} s.1 ∧ Small.{u} s.2}
```

We can prove that this is a `QPF`, which then allows us to build its initial algebra through
`QPF.Fix`, which is exactly the inductive type `IGame`. As a bonus, we're able to describe the
coinductive type of loopy games `LGame` as the final coalgebra `QPF.Cofix` of the exact same
functor.

universe u

/-- The functor from a type into the subtype of small pairs of sets in that type.

This is the quotient of a polynomial functor. The type `IGame` of well-founded games is defined as
the initial algebra of that `QPF`, while the type `LGame` of loopy games is defined as its final
coalgebra.

In other words, `IGame` and `LGame` have the following descriptions (which don't work verbatim due
to various Lean limitations):

```
inductive IGame : Type (u + 1)
  | ofSets (s t : Set IGame) [Small.{u} s] [Small.{u} t] : IGame

coinductive LGame : Type (u + 1)
  | ofSets (s t : Set LGame) [Small.{u} s] [Small.{u} t] : LGame
```
