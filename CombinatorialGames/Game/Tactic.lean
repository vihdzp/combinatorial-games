# Tactic for game inequalities

This file defines the `game_cmp` tactic, capable of proving inequalities between games. See its
docstring for more info.

Tests for the tactic are found in the `CombinatorialGames.Test` file.
-/

/-- Proves simple inequalities on concrete games.

This tactic works by repeatedly unfolding the definition of `≤` and applying `simp` lemmas tagged
with `game_cmp` until the goal is solved. It is effective on any game whose moves can be
"enumerated" by `simp`, in the sense that a quantifier over its moves can be written in a
quantifier-less way. For instance, `∀ y ∈ leftMoves {{0, 1} | {2, 3}}ᴵ, P y` can be simplified into
`P 0 ∧ P 1`.

## Which lemmas to tag

Lemmas which are safe to tag with `game_cmp` are the following:

* Lemmas of the form `(∀ y ∈ leftMoves (f x), P y) ↔ _` and analogous, as long as any quantifiers
  in the simplified form are over left or right moves of simpler games.
* Lemmas of the form `leftMoves (f x) = _` and analogous, as long as the simplified set is of the
  form `{x₁, x₂, …}`, listing out all elements explicitly.
* Lemmas which directly replace games by other simpler games.

Tagging any other lemmas might lead to `simp` failing to eliminate all quantifiers, and getting
stuck in a goal that it can't solve.
