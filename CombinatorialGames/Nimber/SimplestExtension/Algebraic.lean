# Nimbers are algebraically closed

This file aims to prove the last part of the simplest extension theorem (see
`CombinatorialGames.Nimber.SimplestExtension.Basic`), and to deduce, as a corollary, that the
nimbers are algebraically closed.

/-! ### n-th degree closed fields -/

/-- A nimber `x` is `n`-th degree closed when `IsRing x`, and every non-constant polynomial in the
nimbers with degree less or equal to `n` and coefficients less than `x` has a root that's less than
`x`. Note that `0` and `1` are `n`-th degree closed under this definition.

We don't extend `IsField x`, as for `1 ≤ n`, this predicate implies it.

For simplicity, the constructor takes a `0 < p.degree` assumption. The theorem
`IsNthDegreeClosed.exists_root` proves that this theorem applies (vacuously) when `p = 0`
as well. -/
