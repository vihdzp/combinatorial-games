# Domineering as a combinatorial game.

We define the game of Domineering, played on a chessboard of arbitrary shape
(possibly even disconnected).
Left moves by placing a domino vertically, while Right moves by placing a domino horizontally.

This is only a fragment of a full development;
in order to successfully analyse positions we would need some more theorems.
Most importantly, we need a general statement that allows us to discard irrelevant moves.
Specifically to domineering, we need the fact that
disjoint parts of the chessboard give sums of games.
