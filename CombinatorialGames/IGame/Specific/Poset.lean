# Poset games

Let `α` be a partially ordered type (in fact, a preorder suffices). One can define the following
impartial game: two players alternate turns choosing an element `a : α`, and "removing" the entire
interval `Ici a` from the poset. As usual, whoever runs out of moves loses.

In a general poset, this game need not terminate. Adding the condition that `α` is well
quasi-ordered (well-founded with no infinite antichains) is both sufficient and necessary to
guarantee a finite game.

This setup generalizes other well-known games within CGT, most notably Chomp, which is simply the
poset game on `(Fin m × Fin n) \ {⊥}`.

## Main results

* `PGame.Poset.impartial_toPGame`: poset games are impartial
* `PGame.Poset.univ_fuzzy_zero`: any poset game with a top element is won by the second player,
  shown via a strategy stealing argument
