/-- Games up to equivalence.

If `x` and `y` are combinatorial games (`IGame`), we say that `x ≈ y` when both `x ≤ y` and `y ≤ x`.
Broadly, this means neither player has a preference in playing either game, as a component of a
larger game. This is the standard meaning of `x = y` in the literature, though it is not a strict
equality, e.g. `{0, 1 | 0}` and `{1 | 0}` are equivalent, but not identical as the former has an
extra move for Left.

In particular, note that a `Game` has no well-defined notion of left and right options. This means
you should prefer `IGame` when analyzing specific games. -/

This is given notation `{s | t}ᴳ`, where the superscript `G` is to disambiguate from set builder
notation, and from the analogous constructor on `IGame`.

Note that although this function is well-defined, recovering the left/right sets from a game is not,
as there are many sets that can generate a single game. -/
